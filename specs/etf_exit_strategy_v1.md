# ETF Exit Strategy (3-Week Structured Sell Ladder)

This section outlines a **structured exit strategy** for selling out of a position over three weeks.  
It replaces the older assumption of using a **monotonic increasing ladder** (which is ideal for trims, not exits).  
This strategy is for **full exits**, not partial reductions.

## Why Not Just Use a Market Order?

While a market order gives instant certainty, it also guarantees **zero control** over price.  
The structured 3-week ladder gives you **most of the exit certainty** — while keeping **some price control** and reducing regret.

---

## Core Intuition

- **Week 1**: Start selling — not waiting. Begin the exit but keep some upside exposure.
- **Week 2**: Sell most of what remains. This is the real workhorse.
- **Week 3**: Final push. Place a high-probability limit order, but a full exit is not guaranteed.

This is **not slow-motion dithering**. It’s a fast, disciplined exit.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1 – Start the Exit (Reversed Monotonic Ladder)

- Use a **reversed monotonic structure**: biggest size close to the current price, smaller amounts higher up.
- You are **not waiting** for a huge rally — you are beginning the exit with realism.
- Focus on placing several **limit orders just above current price**.
- Leave a small tail for ambitious moves, but don't count on them.

**Goal**: Begin the exit. Sell a meaningful chunk.

### Week 2 – Complete Most of the Exit (Heavily Front-Loaded)

- You’re now committed.  
- Stack your limit orders close to the current price.  
- Don’t hold out for anything ambitious — this week is about **high-probability fills**.

**Goal**: Exit the bulk of the remaining position.

---

### Week 3 – Finalise (Single Limit Order or Market)

- Place a **single limit order** close to current price — something highly likely to fill.
- If it doesn’t fill by Tuesday morning, convert to market order.
- Avoid hesitation. You’ve had 2 weeks of controlled exit — now finish it.

**Goal**: Fully exit the position, no regret, no guesswork.

---

## Summary of Benefits

- You stay **structured**, not emotional.
- You keep **price control**, without losing exit certainty.
- You avoid the regret of premature market selling.
- You leverage the same logic used in your trading ladders — just compressed.

This is how to exit **with discipline and dignity**, not desperation.
