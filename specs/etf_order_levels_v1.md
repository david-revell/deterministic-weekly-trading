# ETF Order Levels Cheatsheet (Weekly Focus)

This cheatsheet ranks common buy/sell order levels by their **usefulness on weekly charts**, considering both psychological weight and analytical meaning.  
ATR is not used here as a scoring input — it is already baked into the Buy and Sell ladders.  
However, its relevance shifts with market state (see Momentum/Reversal scale).

## Buy Levels (Below Current Price)

| Level                        | Type           | Weekly Usefulness | Comment |
|------------------------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| EMA(26)                      | Analytical     | Strong            | Key trend anchor on weekly charts. Institutions watch this. |
| 0.5x ATR (Below)             | Analytical     | Strong            | Sweet spot: not noise, not extreme. Vol-adjusted, robust. |
| 1x ATR (Below)               | Analytical     | Strong            | Large weekly pullback zone. High conviction if reached. |
| S1 / S2                      | Psychological  | Moderate          | Less used on weeklies, but gain weight in reversal setups. |
| EMA(12)                      | Analytical     | Moderate          | Captures medium trend pullbacks. Useful in momentum phases. |
| EMA(5)                       | Analytical     | Weaker            | Too close on weeklies, more a daily signal. |
| LL(5)                        | Analytical     | Weaker            | Short-term low. Can matter, but noisy on weeklies. |
| PP (Pivot Point)             | Psychological  | Weak              | Rarely followed at weekly scale. |
| BB SMA(20) Lower +0.5%       | Analytical     | Weak              | More relevant on daily; weeklies stretch too far. |

## Sell Levels (Above Current Price)

| Level                        | Type           | Weekly Usefulness | Comment |
|------------------------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| 1.5x ATR (Above)             | Analytical     | Strong            | Best balance of probability vs reward. Core sell trigger. |
| 2x ATR (Above)               | Analytical     | Strong            | Extreme rallies. Rare but valuable. |
| R1 / R2                      | Psychological  | Moderate          | Some follow them, more relevant in reversal phases. |
| HH(5)                        | Analytical     | Moderate          | Short-term high. Useful for profit-taking, but noisy. |
| 1.25x ATR (Above)            | Analytical     | Moderate          | Often too close on weeklies; prone to noise. |
| BB SMA(20) Upper –0.5%       | Analytical     | Weak              | Daily relevance > weekly relevance. |

## Integration with Momentum/Reversal Scale

The importance of ATR vs Support/Resistance shifts with momentum:

| Score Range | Priority Levels | Reason |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **5–4 (Momentum Up)** | ATR multiples, EMAs | Trend intact → volatility-based levels dominate. |
| **3 (Neutral)** | Either | Market mixed → ATR or support/resistance can both be used. |
| **2–1 (Reversal)** | Support/Resistance (S1, S2, R1, R2), HH/LL | Trend weakening/reversing → pivot-style and classical support/resistance gain weight. |

## Summary

- **Core weekly anchors**: ATR multiples (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x) and EMA(26).  
- **Secondary context**: EMA(12), S1/S2, R1/R2, HH(5).  
- **Weaker weekly signals**: EMA(5), LL(5), pivots, Bollinger bands.  
- ATR context: baked into ladders, but dominant when momentum is up (scores 4–5).  
- Support/resistance: gain importance when reversal risk is high (scores 1–2).
