# ETF Dividend Strategy Cheatsheet

## Key principle
- Pullback trader → **adjust ladders by dividend amount** in ex-div weeks.  
- This avoids “phantom” dips that would otherwise trigger buys.  

## When to adjust
- ETF is **distributing** (VUSA, ISF, EQQQ).  
- Dividend is **≥0.3% of price** (material vs typical pullback).  
- Ex-dividend week only.  

## When not to adjust
- ETF is **accumulating** (SMGB, SGLN) → no dividend.  
- Dividend size **<0.1%** (too small to matter vs ATR/pullback stats).  

## Practical steps
1. **Check ex-div dates** (dividenddata.co.uk / divvydiary.com).  
2. Note the **per-share dividend**.  
3. Subtract dividend from each ladder rung that week.  
4. Resume normal laddering the following week.  

## Examples
- **VUSA Sep 2025**  
  - Dividend: £0.44  
  - Price ~£92 → drop ~0.48%  
  - Adjust ladder: –£0.44 each rung.  

- **ISF Sep 2025**  
  - Dividend: 6.62p  
  - Price ~915p → drop ~0.72%  
  - Adjust ladder: –£0.066 each rung.  

- **SGLN**  
  - No dividend → no adjustment ever.  

## Bottom line
- Liquidity trumps dividend choice → stick with distributing ETFs.  
- Adjust ladders in ex-div weeks to keep pullback stats valid.  
- Otherwise ignore dividends; 11 out of 12 weeks are normal.
