# ETF Rotation Exit Rules Cheatsheet (Structured Unwind Logic)

This file defines the rules for **rotating out of one ETF into another**, within your strict **Monday-only, 3-week sell** framework.

---

## 1. Trigger to Begin Exit (Source ETF)

You **initiate the 3-week sell** when:

- The ETF’s **momentum score drops to 3 or below** on a Friday  
- No need to wait for two consecutive 3s — a single week is enough  
- You always sell using **limit orders above price** (never below)  
- If price collapses, you may **choose** to convert to market — but only deliberately  

---

## 2. Condition for New Buys (Destination ETF)

You **only place buy ladders** during/after the rotation **if** the destination ETF:

- Scores **4 or 5** on the same Friday  
- If not, **hold cash** until the next review — no midweek changes  

---

## 3. Timeframe

- **Each rotation takes 4 weeks minimum**:  
  - 3 Mondays to sell  
  - 1 Monday to buy  
- This naturally limits frequency — expect **~1 full rotation every 3–6 months**  
- Avoids overtrading, aligns with your **slow, structured weekly strategy**  

---

## 4. Core Pair Assumption

Your baseline pair is:

- **EQQQ + SGLN**  
- Other ETFs may be rotated **in or out** — but EQQQ/SGLN are treated as the **default state** unless replaced with structural justification  

---

## 5. What if Price Improves?

- If the **source ETF recovers to 4/5** during the unwind:  
  → **Continue the 3-week exit** anyway — decision was already made  
- If the **destination ETF drops below 4** mid-rotation:  
  → **Pause buys** — reassess the following Friday  

---

## Summary

This cheatsheet turns vague “rotation” into a structured, rule-based unwind:  
- Exit is triggered by score = 3  
- Buys only occur if destination = 4 or 5  
- Never react midweek  
- Stay disciplined, not momentum-chasing
