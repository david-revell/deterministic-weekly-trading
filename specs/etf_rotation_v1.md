# Updating the Cheatsheet with New ETFs

**Roles:** You = ChatGPT, I = David.

When I want to add new ETFs to the **Rotation Tracker**:

1. I send a short request like:  
   *“I have new ETFs for the Rotation Tracker, check etf_rotation_cheatsheet.md for what I need: <list of ETFs>”*

2. You (ChatGPT) will:  
   - Read **etf_rotation_cheatsheet.md** for the required columns.  
   - Create new rows with:  
     | Ticker | Name | Profile | Classification | Volatility (1–10) | Liquidity (1–10) | Weekly Trader Fit (1–10) | Potential Fit (text) |  
   - Return those rows into the chat.

3. I (David) then manually add those new rows into the **“T212 ETFs” worksheet** in **etf_rotation_tracker.xlsx**.

# ETF Rotation Cheatsheet  

## 1. Core distinction  
- **Anchors:** Broad trackers (S&P 500, All-World, FTSE 100, MSCI World). They almost always appear in Top 10 lists. Low volatility, investor flows, poor trading edge.  
- **Rotators:** Thematics (Gold, Silver, Defence, Crypto, Tech, AI). They move up/down in rank as sentiment shifts. More volatile, more edge for active trading.  

## 2. Reading Rank Changes  
- **Up in rank** → fresh inflows, momentum building. Candidate for entry.  
- **Down in rank** → crowd exiting, profit-taking. Candidate for exit.  
- **New entry** → hype trade, risky, but potential short-term opportunity.  
- **Exit from Top 10** → theme faded, don’t chase.  

## 3. Practical Application  
- **Ignore returns (%):** they’re lagging.  
- **Focus on rank shifts:** they show where crowd money is moving *now*.  
- **Cross-check with TA:** EMA (trend) and MACD-H (momentum) to confirm.  
- **Jump-on / Jump-off:** Ride hot rotations for 3–6 months max. Always use market order exits.  

## 4. Examples (for reference only)  
- **SGLN (Gold):** Repeated rotations in/out, great for 4-month holds.  
- **DFNG (Defence):** Spiked high, dropped fast — classic rotation fade.  
- **DAGB (Crypto):** New entry with hype. Dangerous late-stage trade.  
- **EQQQ (Nasdaq):** Slow steady riser, less hype, more durable rotation.

## 5. Using II vs Barclays Lists  

- **II (interactive investor)**  
  - Monthly *flow-based* data (rank changes month-to-month).  
  - Best for spotting **rotations**: up/down movements reveal where hot money is moving.  
  - Treat it as your **rotation radar**.  

- **Barclays**  
  - Shows *holdings concentration* (% of investor money in each ETF).  
  - Best for understanding **anchors vs niche slices**. Anchors (S&P 500, All-World, FTSE 100) dominate, but occasionally a niche thematic (e.g. ARCI, AI & Robotics) appears.  
  - Use it as an **anchor map** — it shows where most investors are parked, but also highlights when something niche is starting to break into the mainstream.  

**Together:**  
- II = the **flow signal** (short-term rotations).  
- Barclays = the **base positioning map** (where the crowd’s cash sits, and which niche ETFs are creeping in).

## 6. Data Sources (Top 10 ETF lists)  
- Barclays: Top 10 purchases (8–14 August 2025)  
  https://www.barclays.co.uk/smart-investor/investments/most-popular/etfs/  

- II (interactive investor): Top 10 most-popular ETFs in July 2025  
  https://www.ii.co.uk/etfs/top-etfs  

**Note:** II is generally stronger for *rotation signals* because it reflects monthly buy orders. Barclays is better for *context* — where the anchor money is, with occasional thematic outliers.
